You may copy and distribute such a system following the terms of the

provided that you include the source code of that other code when

Note that people who make modified versions of Engine3 are not obligated
to grant this special exception for their modified versions;
it is their choice whether to do so. The GNU Lesser General Public License

this exception also makes it possible to release a modified version
